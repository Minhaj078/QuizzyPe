2. Design Decisions & Next.js Implementation
📄 Static Site Generation (SSG)
QuizzyPe uses SSG to pre-render pages at build time for optimal performance.

src/app/page.js – The homepage lists all categories using static data.

src/app/quizzes/[category]/page.js – Uses generateStaticParams to pre-render quiz pages by category.

src/app/quiz/[id]/page.js – Dynamically generates quiz pages by quiz ID.

✅ Benefits:
Improves SEO, performance, and load times as static HTML is served.

🔁 Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Currently not used, but the app is structured in a way to support SSR in future for user-authenticated dashboards or real-time updates.

🔌 API Routes
Not implemented yet – static data is directly imported.
Future versions may include login, leaderboard, or dynamic content using API routes.

🖼️ next/image
Used to optimize images across the platform. Benefits include:

Lazy loading

WebP conversion

Automatic resizing

3. Challenges Faced & Solutions
🧠 Server and Client Component Split
Challenge:
Managing quiz state, localStorage (client-side) with data fetching (server-side).

Solution:

Marked QuizClient.js as a "use client" component.

Passed data from server (page.js) to client via props.

Handled all logic/state in QuizClient.

4. AI Coding Tools Utilization
